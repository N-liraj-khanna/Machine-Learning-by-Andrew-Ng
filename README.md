# Machine Learning by Professor Andrew Ng (Coursera)
This is my solution to all the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by professor Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
